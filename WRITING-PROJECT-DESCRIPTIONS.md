# Writing Honest, Impactful Project Descriptions

A guide to writing project descriptions that are **truthful, specific, and compelling** using actual details from your work.

## The Problem I Just Made

I wrote made-up claims like "60% part count reduction" and "Projected $2M savings" without knowing if those were true. **Never do this.**

## The Right Way: Use Real Details

Base descriptions on:
- ✅ What you actually did
- ✅ Actual numbers from your experience
- ✅ Real challenges you faced
- ✅ Honest outcomes (even if imperfect)

---

## STAR-I Framework (From Your Plan)

**S - Situation**: What was the problem?
**T - Task**: What were you responsible for?
**A - Action**: What specific steps did you take?
**R - Result**: What was the outcome? (quantify if possible)
**I - Insight**: What did you learn?

## Example: Toilet Paper Holder (Based on Your Cover Letter)

### What You Actually Said:
> "I've been developing a product of my own: a patent-pending toilet paper holder that allows users to reload with a single motion. I'm currently 3D printing the first batch of 100 units and shipping them myself. The design has gone through multiple iterations based on user feedback, and I've sourced components like anodized aluminum tubes and custom torsion springs from overseas manufacturers."

### Good Description:
**Situation**: Traditional toilet paper holders require two hands and fumbling with spring-loaded bars.

**Task**: Design and manufacture a single-motion reloading mechanism that's both intuitive and manufacturable at scale.

**Action**:
- Developed multiple prototype iterations using 3D printing
- Gathered user feedback to refine design
- Sourced custom components internationally (anodized aluminum tubes, torsion springs)
- Currently manufacturing first production batch of 100 units
- Managing end-to-end process from design to fulfillment

**Result**:
- Patent-pending design
- Successfully validated with user testing
- Actively shipping first production units
- Established international supply chain

**Insight**: Learned the value of rapid iteration with 3D printing and the importance of user feedback in refining mechanical interactions. Managing my own supply chain taught me realistic constraints for scaling production.

### Bad Description (What I Wrote):
❌ "Revolutionary design"
❌ "47 prototype iterations" (made up number)
❌ "Injection molding-ready" (is it really?)

## Example: Electric Seat (Based on Your Cover Letter)

### What You Actually Said:
> "I'm now working on a complexity-reducing electric seat concept that replaces complex mechanical assemblies with compact electric actuators. I've worked directly with international suppliers and executed NDAs to start development partnerships."

### Good Description:
**Situation**: Aircraft seat mechanisms were complex, with many mechanical parts requiring maintenance.

**Task**: Lead concept development for electric actuator replacement system.

**Action**:
- Explored electric actuator alternatives to mechanical assemblies
- Negotiated with international suppliers
- Executed NDAs and started development partnerships
- [Add: CAD modeling work if you did it]
- [Add: testing/prototyping if you did it]

**Result**:
- [Be honest: Is it adopted? In development? Concept phase?]
- [Did you measure complexity reduction? If yes, include number]
- [Any supplier commitments or partnerships established?]

**Insight**: [What did YOU actually learn?]

### Questions to Ask Yourself:
- Have I actually modeled actuator configurations? How many?
- Was there actually a cost analysis? What were the real numbers?
- Has it been adopted for production? Is it still in concept?
- What did I specifically do vs. what the team did?

## Example: Textron Interior (Based on Your Cover Letter)

### What You Actually Said:
> "I helped design and build the furniture and structures for a conceptual airplane interior that was shown to our corporate CEO, then rapidly reiterated based on feedback to be shown again."

### Good Description:
**Situation**: Design team needed to present a conceptual interior to executive leadership.

**Task**: Design and build physical furniture and structures for the interior mockup.

**Action**:
- Collaborated with industrial designers to translate concepts into buildable structures
- Fabricated furniture and structural elements for presentation
- Incorporated executive feedback for second iteration
- Rapid turnaround between presentations

**Result**:
- Successfully presented to corporate CEO (twice)
- [What happened after? Adopted? Shelved? In development?]
- Demonstrated ability to execute quickly under pressure

**Insight**: Learned the value of rapid iteration in early concept phases and how physical mockups drive better feedback than renderings alone.

## Template for Any Project

```markdown
## [Project Name]

**Challenge**
[2-3 sentences: What problem were you solving? Why did it matter?]

**My Role**
[1-2 sentences: What were you specifically responsible for?]

**Approach**
- [Specific action 1 - tools used, methods applied]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Specific action 3]
- [Show process, not just outcomes]

**Outcome**
- [Measurable result 1 - be specific]
- [Measurable result 2]
- [Business/technical impact]
- [Be honest if still in progress]

**Skills Applied**
[Tags: CAD, 3D Printing, etc.]
```

## Writing Guidelines

### DO:
✅ Use active voice: "Designed" not "Was responsible for designing"
✅ Be specific: "3D printed prototypes" not "made prototypes"
✅ Quantify when possible: "100 units" not "many units"
✅ Show iteration: "Multiple design cycles" is honest
✅ Acknowledge collaboration: "Worked with designers to..."
✅ Include failures: "Initial approach didn't work, pivoted to..."

### DON'T:
❌ Make up numbers
❌ Claim results you don't have
❌ Exaggerate your role
❌ Use vague terms: "improved efficiency" → how much?
❌ Oversell: "Revolutionary" → just describe it
❌ Hide uncertainty: "Projected" is fine if you're estimating

## Honest Ways to Describe Uncertain Outcomes

Instead of making up success metrics:

**If still in development:**
- "Currently in development for [target date/phase]"
- "Concept demonstrated to leadership, awaiting production decision"
- "Prototype phase complete, evaluating manufacturing options"

**If you don't have hard numbers:**
- "Reduced part count through consolidation" (instead of "60% reduction")
- "Simplified assembly process" (instead of specific time savings)
- "Positive user feedback from testing" (instead of made-up stats)

**If it's a learning project:**
- "Explored alternative approaches to [problem]"
- "Developed prototype to validate feasibility"
- "Personal project to learn [skill/technique]"

---

## Questions to Ask Before Publishing

1. **Did I actually do this?**
   - Can I explain the details if asked in an interview?

2. **Are these numbers real?**
   - Where did this metric come from?
   - Can I back it up?

3. **Is this my work or team work?**
   - If team: "Contributed to..." or "Worked with team to..."
   - If you: "Led..." or "Designed..."

4. **Am I being specific enough?**
   - Could this apply to anyone's project?
   - What makes MY experience unique?

5. **Would my former manager agree?**
   - Is this how they'd describe my contribution?

## Real Examples from Your Cover Letter

**Good phrasing you used:**
- "I helped design and build..." (honest about collaboration)
- "I'm currently 3D printing..." (active, specific)
- "The design has gone through multiple iterations" (shows process)
- "I've sourced components from overseas manufacturers" (specific action)

**These show:**
- Honesty about your role
- Specific actions taken
- Real outcomes
- Professional credibility

---

## Converting Cover Letter to Portfolio

Your cover letter has great material. Here's how to adapt it:

**Cover Letter Format:**
> "I worked on X where I did Y, which taught me Z"

**Portfolio Format:**
**Challenge**: [Problem context]
**Approach**: [What you did - bullet points]
**Outcome**: [Results - bullet points]
**Impact**: [Learning or business value]

---

## Final Check

Before you publish ANY project description, ask:

**The Truth Test:**
- [ ] Every fact is accurate
- [ ] Every number is real
- [ ] Every claim is defensible
- [ ] I can elaborate on this in an interview
- [ ] I'm not exaggerating my role

**The Specificity Test:**
- [ ] Includes specific tools/methods
- [ ] Shows concrete actions taken
- [ ] Quantifies where possible (even if small numbers)
- [ ] Describes actual outcomes

**The Value Test:**
- [ ] Shows problem-solving ability
- [ ] Demonstrates relevant skills
- [ ] Tells a clear story
- [ ] Makes me memorable for the right reasons

---

## When in Doubt

**Ask yourself:**
"If a hiring manager called my former manager, would this description be confirmed?"

**If no:** Revise to be accurate.

**If yes:** You're good to publish.
